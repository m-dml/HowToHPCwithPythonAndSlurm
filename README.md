# HowToHPCwithPythonAndSlurm

This repo contains some examples on how to use python on a HPC system with slurm.
In the `Examples` folder you will find notebooks showing you how to parallelize vector
operations with ``dask`` or how to use ``RAY`` together with `joblib` to parallelize
nearly any python loop.
